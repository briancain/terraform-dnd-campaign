# Terraform DND Campaign Generator

This module will create a GitHub Pages static site from the template defined
inside this repository. It uses the result of rolling 4 20-sided die to determine
what kind of D&D campaign you will be running.

## Notes

This Terraform module was created using the [terraform-provider-diceroll](https://github.com/briancain/terraform-provider-diceroll) provider.
